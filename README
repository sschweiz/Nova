Using git Properly with Nova:

 0) Install & setup git
    Gentoo:         emerge git
    Fedora/CentOS:  yum install git-core
    Debian/Ubunto:  apt-get install git-core
    Other:          http://git-scm.com/download
	
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "Your Email"
 1) Add your ssh rsa public key to the project keyring, generating one if you
    don't have it.
	
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "Your Email"
 
 2) Create a github.com account at http://github.com
 3) Fork our repository at http://github.com/sme/Nova
 4) Clone our forked repository on your system get it up-to-date
 
    cd projects
    git clone git@github.com:<username>/Nova.git
    git remote add upstream git://github.com/sme/Nova.git
    git fetch upstream
	
 5) Start coding!
 
Working with our github:

 - When you are ready to add changes to the main project stream, you need to
   push your current working branch to your github Nova fork.  Then, you
   must initiate a pull request.
 - If and when we approve your changes, your working branch will be merged
   into our edge branch.  This is the current bleeding edge of the Nova
   project.
 - We will *try* to merge edge->nightly every night.  But there is no real
   gaurentee that we will actually get around to doing this every day.
   
Notes:
 - DO NOT BREAK THE EDGE BUILD!  If you do, people will be angry with you!
   The point of the edge branch is to provide a working building block that
   other developers are able to fetch/merge from if they want the most
   recent view of the sourcecode.
 - If you do break something, either rebase, or fetch from the latest nightly
   build.
